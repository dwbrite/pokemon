# Pokemon

A classic remake of Pokemon gen 3 with extra features and modifications.

## Getting Started with Development

1. Install and configure Gradle: https://gradle.org/install/
2. Clone the project: `git clone git@github.com:dwbrite/pokemon.git`
3. Run the game with `gradle run`, or
create a distributable zip file with `gradle gameZip`.

You may want to save these commands as configurations in your IDE.

Congrats, you can compile and run the game!
I think. I *may* have missed something.

TODO: Add mind-map explaining the structure of the game.
That might actually call for a Wiki.
