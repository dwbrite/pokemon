# Pokemon

A classic remake of Pokemon gen 3 with extra features and modifications.

## Getting Started with Development

1. Install and configure Gradle version 4+: https://gradle.org/install/
  (Note: Do not install gradle from your system's base package manager. It's almost guaranteed not to work.)
2. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/dwbrite/pokemon.git`
3. Run the game with `gradle run`, or
create a distributable zip file with `gradle gameZip`.

You may want to save these commands as configurations in your IDE.

Congrats, you can compile and run the game!
I think. I *may* have missed something.

TODO: Add mind-map explaining the structure of the game.
That might actually call for a Wiki.
