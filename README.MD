# Pokemon

A classic remake of Pokemon gen 3 with extra features and modifications.

## Getting Started with Development

1. Install and configure JDK 8.
2. Install and configure Gradle version 4+: https://gradle.org/install/
    * (Note: Do not install gradle from your system's **default** package manager. It's almost guaranteed not to work. The AUR may work.)
    * (You can use a Gradle wrapper instead of installing gradle to your system. In IntelliJ IDEA, just click "Use gradle 'wrapper' task configuration" when importing)
3. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/dwbrite/pokemon.git`
4. Run the game with `gradle run`, or
create a distributable zip file with `gradle gameZip`.

You may want to save these commands as configurations in your IDE.

Congrats, you can compile and run the game!
